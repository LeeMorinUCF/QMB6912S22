Where LaTeX shines is in the display of equations.
My personal conspiracy theory for the appalling lack of quality of
equation rendering in the Windows suite
is that Bill Gates deliberately sabotages any capability for Windows
products to display equations adequately.
The people at Microsoft could certainly do it but they just don't.
It's the only possible explanation to prevent them from rendering equations in a manner that is even remotely adequate for mathematical communication.
Maybe it has to do with dropping out of a math program in college.
I think about it far too often.

In any case, the simple equation environment is indicated by the dollar sign ```$```.
This is typically used for inline equations, such as
```$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$```.

For larger expressions, the ```equation``` environment is preferred:

```
\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
```

Entire books have been written about interacting with the ```equation``` environment. Most writers use the Internet.


We will use LaTeX to typeset some equations
to describe potential regression specifications.
