\section{Data Description}
% 
By engaging an industry consultant to gather relevant and appropriate 
information, your firm has been able to put together data concerning 248 
different fly-fishing reels, over one-half of which are produced in the 
United States, with the remainder being produced in Asia---either in China 
or Korea.  These data are contained in the file {\tt FlyReels.csv}, which is
available in the {\tt Data} folder.
Each fly-fishing reel in the data set is a row, while the columns correspond 
to the variables whose names and definitions are the following:
\bigskip
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \hline
    Variable & Definition \\
  \hline

    {\tt Name}        &product name (a string) \\ 
    {\tt Brand}       &brand name (a string) \\ 
    {\tt Weight}      &weight of reel in ounces (a real number) \\ 
    {\tt Diameter}    &diameter of reel in inches (a real number) \\ 
    {\tt Width}       &width of reel in inches (a real number) \\ 
    {\tt Price}       &price of reel in dollars (a real number) \\ 
    {\tt Sealed}      &whether the reel is sealed; {\tt "Yes"} versus
                        {\tt "No"} (a string) \\ 
    {\tt Country}     &country of manufacture, (a string) \\ 
    {\tt Machined}    &whether the reel is machined versus cast;
                        machined={\tt "Yes"}, \\ 
                      &while cast={\tt "No"} (a string) \\ 
  \hline

I will revisit the recommended linear model
from Problem Set \#7, 
which was supported in
Problem Sets \#8 and  \#9 
by considering other nonlinear specifications
within a Generalized Additive Model. 



Then I will further investigate this nonlinear relationship
by considering the issue of sample selection:
fly reel manufacturers 
may produce 
fly reels in each country
with specific qualities based on
their perceived value to typical 
American 
customers, 
in ways that are not represented by the variables in the dataset.

\section{Linear Regression Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A natural staring point is the recommended linear model
from Problem Set \#7. 

\subsection{Linear Model with \texttt{Sealed*Made\_in\_USA} Interaction}

Last week I investigated whether 
the functional form should include different specifications by
country of manufacture.
% 
The model included the continuous variables 
width, diameter, and density, 
as well as categorical variables for 
country of manufacture, 
and whether or not the reels were sealed or machined. 
% 
In addition to the indicator for the country of manufacture, the model included an indicator for an interaction between
the the country of manufacture indicator and the indicator for whether the reels were sealed or unsealed. 
% 
The dependent variable was chosen as 
the logarithm of the fly reel price, 
since the results were similar to those from the model 
with the optimal Box-Cox transformation, 
without the added complexity. 
% 
The results of this regression specification are shown in 
Table \ref{tab:reg_sealed_USA}. 
% 
\input{../Tables/reg_sealed_USA}
% 
Next, I will attempt to improve on this specification,
using Tobit models for sample selection.

\subsection{Predicting the Selection into Samples}


The specification in 
Table \ref{tab:reg_sq_horse}
assumes a linear functional form for
the relationship between characteristics and prices of fly reels, 
without selecting into samples by brand.
% 
To investigate this relationship further, 
consider the set of variables that are related to
whether or not 
a manufacturer decides to manufacture fly reels in 
America or overseas
with the characteristics observed in the dataset.
